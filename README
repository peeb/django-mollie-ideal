Mollie/iDEAL Payments for Django
================================

This package provides a Python interface to the iDEAL API by Mollie.nl
for use in Django projects. It requires Python 2.5 or higher.

iDEAL is an payment system used in the Netherlands which allows Dutch
consumers to make online payments via the secure environment of their
own bank.

Mollie.nl provide a unified API which removes the complexity of
interacting with the individual Dutch banks which support iDEAL
payments. You can find detailed information about the Mollie.nl iDEAL
API at
